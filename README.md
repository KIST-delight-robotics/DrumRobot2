# Ubuntu-Based CAN Communication Robot Drummer
This project is a unique endeavor that leverages CAN communication to control nine motors within a Linux Ubuntu environment, enabling a robot to play drums. It's designed for music enthusiasts and tech aficionados alike, blending robotics with artistry to create rhythmic music.


## Features
- **Precision Motor Control**: Utilizing advanced algorithms in C++ to control Tmotor and Maxon motors with high precision, enabling accurate and dynamic drumming.
- **Real-Time System Performance**: Leveraging Linux Ubuntu with a Real-Time Kernel to ensure immediate response and consistent performance during drumming sequences.
- **Integrated User Interface**: A collaborative effort in Qt for GUI development, focusing on seamless integration between the control logic and user interface for intuitive user interaction.
- **Efficient Motor Communication**: Implementing the CAN Bus Protocol with SocketCAN Library for reliable and efficient communication between the control system and motors.
- **Robust Sensory Feedback**: Incorporating USB IO devices and proximity sensors for precise homing and positioning, enhancing the overall accuracy and consistency of the robot's movements.



## Technology Stack

### Software
- **C++**: Used for core algorithm development and motor control logic.
- **Linux Ubuntu with Real-Time Kernel**: Operating system platform modified for robust and stable performance with real-time capabilities.
- **Qt (GUI Development)**: Collaboratively developed with another developer, focusing on integrating the control logic with the GUI for enhanced user interaction.
- **SocketCAN Library**: Employed for implementing the CAN Bus Protocol, facilitating efficient communication with the motors.
